# Statistical Test for Cyber
Chi-Square Test Purpose: To determine if there’s a statistically significant association between the time of day and type of cybersecurity incident.

Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no association between the time of day and the type of cybersecurity incident (i.e., they are independent). 
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is an association between the time of day and the type of cybersecurity incident (i.e., they are dependent).

T-Test Purpose: To test if there’s a statistically significant difference in the average number of login attempts between regular users and malicious users.

Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean number of login attempts for regular and malicious users is the same. 
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean number of login attempts for regular and malicious users is different.

DATASETS
Incident Dataset: Contains categorical data to examine the relationship between Time of Day (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) and Incident Type (e.g., Phishing, Malware, Brute Force, Insider Threat).

Login Dataset: This dataset contains continuous data such as Login Attempts by regular users vs. potentially malicious users, allowing us to test for a significant difference in behavior between the two groups.
